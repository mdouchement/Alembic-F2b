# VPump

The TT VPUMP kit is a very effective working voltage converter which generates an output voltage of 90 V DC to 220 V DC  from a 12V DC input voltage.
The circuit is in use for many years now and it is proven. In this kit the circuit has been adapted to a compact size and optimized for use in small preamplifier chassis. So it is an ideal HV power supply for tube stompboxes and preamps without the need of additional transformers and HV filter capacitors.

The VPump can be operated with a standard 12V DC switching power supply.
The switching power supply is not included in the kit.
